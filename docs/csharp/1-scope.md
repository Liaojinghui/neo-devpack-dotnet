# 1 Scope

This specification describes the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in a subset of the C# programming language used for Neo smart contracts. It describes

- The representation of Neo smart contract programs written in C#;
- The syntax and constraints of the C# subset used for Neo smart contracts;
- The semantic rules for interpreting Neo smart contract programs written in C#;
- The restrictions and limits imposed by the Neo blockchain for C# smart contracts.

This specification does not describe

- The full C# language specification, as only a subset is used for Neo smart contracts;
- The mechanism by which C# smart contracts are compiled and deployed to the Neo blockchain;
- The mechanism by which C# smart contracts are invoked on the Neo blockchain;
- The mechanism by which input data are processed by a C# smart contract on Neo;
- The mechanism by which output data are processed after being produced by a C# smart contract on Neo;
- The size or complexity limitations of a smart contract imposed by the Neo blockchain;
- All minimal requirements of the Neo blockchain that is capable of supporting C# smart contracts.
