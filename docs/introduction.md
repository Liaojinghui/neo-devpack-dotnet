# Introduction

This specification is based on a subset of the standard C# language, specifically tailored for writing smart contracts on the NEO blockchain platform. The original C# language was developed within Microsoft, with Anders Hejlsberg, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde as its principal inventors. This neo C# variant, while maintaining core C# principles, has been adapted to meet the unique requirements and constraints of blockchain environments.

Neo C# is designed to provide developers with a familiar and powerful language for creating smart contracts, while ensuring compatibility with the NEO blockchain's execution environment. As such, it includes several important differences from standard C#:

- NEO C# does not support floating-point types, to ensure deterministic execution across all nodes in the blockchain network.
- File operations are not supported, as smart contracts operate in a sandboxed environment without direct access to the file system.
- Threading is not available, as smart contracts are designed to execute as single-threaded, atomic operations.
- Unsafe code and pointer operations are not supported, to maintain security and prevent direct memory manipulation.
- The `dynamic` keyword is not supported, all types must be clearly defined with a type known at compile time, to ensure security and predictability in smart contract execution.
- Certain other features of standard C# may be limited or unavailable to maintain security and predictability in the blockchain context.

The goals of neo C# include:

- Providing a simple, modern, and object-oriented programming language for smart contract development on the NEO platform.
- Maintaining strong type checking and other software engineering principles to ensure contract reliability and security.
- Offering a familiar syntax for developers with C# experience, to ease the transition into blockchain development.
- Supporting the creation of efficient and cost-effective smart contracts, optimized for execution in the NEO virtual machine.
- Enabling the development of complex decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain-based solutions.

While NEO C# is based on the C# language, it is important for developers to be aware of its specific limitations and optimizations for blockchain use. This specification aims to provide a clear and comprehensive guide to writing smart contracts using NEO C#, highlighting both its capabilities and constraints within the NEO ecosystem.

The name C# is pronounced "C Sharp". And in this specification, when we refer to C#, we mean neo C#.

The name C# is written as the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C (U+0043) followed by the NUMBER SIGN # (U+0023).
